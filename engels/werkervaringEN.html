                self-confidence were very important. I have also experienced rejection from customers here, which
                ensures that I will never get angry with customers if they reject a design or something similar.</td>

                skills, which I later continued to improve.</td>

                we did jobs that ranged from simply painting a wall to laying new walls, flooring, pipes & electricity
                in an attic. I learned a lot here in general, but most importantly te persevere even when something
                seems difficult and to do this without complaining.</td>
